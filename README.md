# Description
The underlying question is to build a model that can predict the cancer class from the given features.
In this project, machine learning models were used to predict the class of five cancers (BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD) using 20531 genes
according to their level of expression in 801 individuals. The collection of data is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set:

<b>BRCA</b>: Breast Invasive Carcinoma <br>
<b>KIRC</b>: Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma <br>
<b>COAD</b>: Colon Adenocarcinoma <br>
<b>LUAD</b>: Lung Adenocarcinoma <br>
<b>PRAD</b>: Prostate Adenocarcinoma
